Remote Prim Manipulation project for Second Life.


A template for LSL web interfaces and anything to do with clicking a button on a website and making something happen in an LSL script. This will get you started, on both the LSL script and the website.




first time seeing this was from my friend:


https://github.com/felix-two-tone/indusys


lots of code copied from him




installation/setup:


set up a flask site on your linux vps with this video


https://youtu.be/KgAtZ1LlNiQ


git clone this repository when he starts talking about making a directory at 3:30 and skip to 5:50 when he starts talking about installing nginx


instead of flask_project just write remotePrimManipulation, including during the gunicorn launch


you can hit ctrl-c to stop the gunicorn process while it's running and close the website


port forward port 80 on your vps through 'ufw allow 80' or some other means if you don't see a website


once you have a website up and running with buttons you can press, go into SL and copy and paste the script from the lsl folder into a default prim with a blank texture


click to open the url it pastes in the chat when you save and run the script, copy the url without the %20 at the end, and you'll be pasting that


into the '\_\_init\_\_.py' script as one of the variables


once you 'nano \_\_init\_\_.py' and place the SLURL variable for url, just save it with ctrl-s, write it with ctrl-o, and close it with ctrl-x


then, run the gunicorn process on ur file again and u should have it up and running and fully functional
